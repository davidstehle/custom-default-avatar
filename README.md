Description
-----------
For users not registered with Gravatar, replace the default “Mystery Man” avatar with a custom avatar of your choosing.

Installation
-----------
Install in just three simple steps!

1. Copy/paste code snippet into your WordPress theme's “functions.php” file.
2. Upload the custom avatar (.png) to your theme’s image folder.
3. Go to WP-Admin —> Settings —> Discussion. The custom avatar should now show in the list of choices. Select it and apply.

*NOTE: Every theme has a functions file stored in the theme's subdirectory, wp-content/themes. Most themes commonly name the functions file “functions.php”. But your theme may name your functions file something slightly different. For example, in Thesis 1.x it’s named “custom_functions.php” and in Thesis 2.x it’s named “custom.php”. Regardless of the name variation, both refer to your functions file.*

**Q) What pixel size should my avatar be?**<br>
The max display size of an avatar is 512x512. Most themes default to 96x96. Although your theme settings may be slightly different.<br>

Because theme settings vary, it’s best to upload an avatar with the max display size of 512x512. While it may seem large, it will help in avoiding distortion as it’s always better to have an image shrunk than stretched. And WordPress will automatically resize the avatar to fit your theme settings.
